# PPSP_simheuristic_Montecarlo_with_GA_Optimization

This code corresponds to a simheuristic approach to the Project Portfolio Selection Problem. 
The risk register, the schedule network (analyzed via critical path method) and baseline cost and stochastic cash flows
are simulated to obtain a project reliability curve.
Project reliabilities are aggregated, considering also correlations to evaluate the portfolio reliability.
Portfolio reliability becomes as a constraint, so that promising portfolios are extracted that maximize returns within a specified reliability level. 
This code uses a realistic instance of 20 projects, and features an experiment to validate the algorithm and evaluate its performance
It also includes a realistic instance generator, for other researchers that may be interested in further testing of alternate algorithms
